# Mario's AdventureCraft ModPack
---
These are the mods I am currently using on the **MC Forge Server.**
This is a combination of QoL (Quality of Life) changes, dependancies, and larger scale mods that directly alter the game.

---
## The current list of mods (**with categories**) is as follows:
### Dependency Mods:
- **GeckoLib** (Ars Nouveau)
- **Patchouli** (Ars Nouveau)
- **Curios** (Ars Nouveau)
- **Citadel** (Alex's Mobs)
- **CreativeCore** (Ambient Sounds 3)
- **SilentLib** (Silent Gear)
- **AutoRegLib** (Quark)

### QoL Mods:
- **ToroHealth**: Shows health bars of mobs that are being _directly_ looked at by the player.
- **Xaeros Minimap**: Adds a minimap showing terrain and mobs. Also allows waypoints to be created and then teleported to.
- **Lumberjack**: Adds _Lumberjack Axes_ that can cut down an entire tree with on block break (tree feller mod, essentially).
- **Just Enough Items**: Provides a menu showing all items (modded or vanilla) and how to craft them.
- **HWLYA**: Describes what the player is looking at (if the player is looking at a dirt block, the top of the screen says it is a dirt block).
- **AppleSkin**: Shows how much a specific food can satiate your hunger when the mouse is hovered over it in your inventory.
- **Ambient Sounds 3**: Adds a diverse array of nature sounds to the game, making MC more immersive.
- **SwingThroughGrass**: Allows players to hit mobs through grass instead of breaking it.
- **Clumps**: Clumps Experience Orbs together into one orb to reduce lag.

### "Normal" Mods:
- **Sophisticated Backpacks**: Allows players to create and use backpacks. Backpacks can be colored and upgraded.
- **DungeonCrawl**: Generates random, huge underground dungeons with loot.
- **Alex's Mobs**: Adds 18 new mobs to the game that are well-animated and fit the vanilla MC style.
- **Ars Nouveau**: Adds a complex magic, mana, and spell system along with new tameable mobs.
- **Aquaculture 2**: Adds dozens of new fish variants, new fishing rods, more complex fishing, and Neptunium gear.
- **Comforts**: Adds sleeping bags and hammocks.
- **Goblin Trader**: Adds goblin traders. They spawn in caves rarely and sell valuable gear and loot.
- **Mutant Beasts**: Adds mini-boss versions of common monster mobs. These have special abilities and unique loot.
- **Ropes Mod!**: Adds craftable ropes used to scale ravines and mountains with more ease.
- **HunterIllager**: Spawns HunterIllager lodges in forests with a new Illager to fight.
- **Valhesia Structures**: Spawns different structures in addition to vanilla.
- **Repurposed Structures**: Spawns more vanilla structures with different variants in more biomes.
- **Silent Gear**: Overhauls the equipment and armor systems to be upgradable/customizable.
- **Quark**: CHanges countless small things about Minecraft while keeping Minecraft feeling like Minecraft.
